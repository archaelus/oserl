1.   Changes 0.1 -> 0.2

- Default values of standard parameters included in the parameter
  descriptor (just like in TLVs).  Lists of PDUs default values do no longer
  exist.

  Refer to smpp_param.hrl in order to change the default value of a parameter.
- Trailing NULL_CHARACTERs in C-Octet Strings are transparently handled
  by encoding/decoding functions.  Application layer does not handle 
  terminating NULLs any more.
- Absolute and relative time formats are now pure C-Octet Strings (Not 
  records).  time record removed.  (Refer to base_syntax.erl, 
  base_syntax.hrl and smpp_base.hrl for further details).
- gen_esme callback interface redefined.
- PDU packing/unpacking functions redefined.
- New macros for composite parameters value definitions.

  For instance, ?DEST_ADDRESS_SME_DEFAULT_VALUE and
  ?DEST_ADDRESS_SME_VALUE/4 were defined for parameter dest_address_sme.

How these changes affected individual files is described below.


1.1  base_syntax.hrl 

- empty base type record definition removed.
- EMPTY macro now defined as 

    -define(EMPTY, ?UNION([])).

- format field in strings is now a Fun. Much more powerful and elegant than
  before.
- HEX_C_OCTET_STRING, DEC_C_OCTET_STRING, HEX_OCTET_STRING and DEC_OCTET_STRING
  macros redefined using new format feature for strings.
- ATIME_C_OCTET_STRING and RTIME_C_OCTET_STRING macros defined using new 
  format feature for strings.


1.2  base_syntax.erl

- Trailing NULL_CHARACTER is transparetly handled by base_syntax:encode/2 and
  base_syntax:decode/2 functions.
- take_until/3 moved to module binary.erl of the common_lib
- is_dec/1 and is_hex/1 moved to module my_string.erl of the common_lib.
- format field in strings is now a Fun. Much more powerful and elegant than
  before.

  decode/2 and encode/2 changed (simplified :-) accordingly.


1.3  param_syntax.hrl 

- Field default added to standard record definition.

  STANDARD macro accordingly updated.


1.4  param_syntax.erl 

- encode_std/2 and encode_tlv/2 are now responsible for encoding default 
  values on standard and mandatory tlvs respectively.


1.5  pdu_syntax.hrl

- command_id added to PDU descriptors.


1.6  pdu_syntax.erl

- Removed pdu_syntax:get_value/2 and pdu_syntax:set_value/3.  Using dictionary
  API instead.

  pdu_syntax functions are no longer used beyond operation API.
- command_id is now included into the PDU descriptor.
- New functions command_id/1 and sequence_number/1.


1.7  smpp_globals.hrl

- $\0 removed from the NULL_C_OCTET_STRING macro.


1.8  smpp_base.hrl

- Trailing $\0 removed from the c_octet_string values.
- Absolute/relative time implemented as pure C-Octet Strings.  Time record 
  finally removed.  Time manipulation is now much more natural... and easy.
- New macros for composite parameters value definitions.

  For instance, ?DEST_ADDRESS_SME_DEFAULT_VALUE and
  ?DEST_ADDRESS_SME_VALUE/4 were defined for parameter dest_address_sme.


1.9  smpp_param.hrl

- Default values added to Standard parameters.
- Default values for TLVs reviewed.


1.10 smpp_pdu.hrl

- Default values moved to smpp_param.hrl.
- Field number_of_messages added to submit_sm, data_sm and submit_multi_sm.
- CDMA and TDMA specific TLVs are no longer commented out.
- command_id added to PDU descriptors.


1.11 operation.erl

- Implemented get_param/2 and set_param/3, replacements for 
  pdu_syntax:get_value/2 and pdu_syntax:set_value/3 respectively.
- new_pdu/5 function removed.  PDU defaults MACROS do no longer exist.
- pack/1, pack_esme/1, pack_mc/1, unpack/1, unpack_esme/1 and unpack_mc/1 
  functions redefined.

1.12 sm.erl

- Calls to pdu_syntax:get_value/2 replaced by operation:get_param/2.


1.13 gen_connection.erl

- retry_status is disabled on die event.
- If already listening on Port, the term {error, {already_listening, Port}} is
  returned for a request to listen on Port (instead of "ok").
- If already connected to Address on Port, the term 
  {error, {already_listening, Address, Port}} is returned for a request to 
  connect to Address on Port (instead of ok).
- Changes in comments.


1.14 gen_esme_session.erl

- Calls to pdu_syntax:get_value/2 replaced by operation:get_param/2.

1.16 Sample files (code_lock_esme.erl, echo_esme.erl and submit_esme.erl)

- Trailing $\0 removed from the c_octet_string values.

See other changes on individual files below.


4.1  smpp_base.hrl

- ESM_CLASS_DOMAIN fixed.  Thanks to hfventer for this fix.  
  The max values were less than the min values! Without this it would be 
  impossible to send binary content messages (like ring tones or WAP push).


4.2  sm.erl

- Functions reply_destination_address/1, reply_source_address/1 and
  reply_addresses/1 added.
  reply_address/1 will be removed in future releases, please use 
  reply_destination_address/1 instead.
- Functions udhi/1 and udhi/2 added.
- Function split_user_data/2 implemented.
- Function chop_udh/1 implemented.
- Function reference_number/1 implemented.
- Function join_user_data/1 added.
- Function total_segments/1 implemented.


4.3  gen_esme_session.erl

- New callback  handle_enquire_link_failure/3 added.
  See http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1206343&forum_id=350015
- Use proc_lib:spawn_link/1 instead of spawn_link.
- New function reference_number/1 implemented.
- PDUs are logged using the new smpp_log event manager.
- Errors reported using the error_logger.
- New callback handle_enquire_link/3 added.
  See http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1206343&forum_id=350015
- Use built in gen_fsm timers.
- Timers (finally :-) redefined.
- Replace request brokers with timers.  Now instead of spawning a
  process for each request, a timer is set.
- enquire_link behavior redefined.  No false enquire_link failures permitted.

  Please see discussions on this subject 
  http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1206343&forum_id=350015
  and http://smsforum.net/smf/index.php?topic=1980.0
- Use smpp_error:format/1 in error reports.
- Show PDUs in hex format in error reports.


4.4  gen_esme.erl

- New callback handle_enquire_link_failure/2 added.
  See http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1206343&forum_id=350015
- handle_alert_notification/2 must have only 2 parameters and not 3, as 
  previously declared in behaviour_info/1.
- Functions session_start_link/2 and session_start_link/3 added.
- Use proc_lib:spawn_link/1 instead of spawn_link.
- Functions submit_sm/3 and	submit_multi/3 added.
- Log utility added.  Functions open_disk_log/1, close_disk_log</a>,
  open_error_logger/1 and close_error_logger/0 implemented.

  By default neither the disk_log nor the error_logger handler are
  added to the smpp_log event manager, thus no logging is done until
  open_disk_log/1 and/or open_error_logger/1 are called.

  Please refer to smpp_log for further information about OSERL logs.
- Implement gen_esme_session callback handle_enquire_link/3.

  http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1206343&forum_id=350015

4.5  smpp_globals.hrl

- SM_MAX_SIZE and SM_SEGMENT_MAX_SIZE macros defined.


4.6  operation.erl

- Use my_lists:ukeymerge/3 in merge_params/2.


4.7  pdu_syntax.erl

- Condition CommandId of 16#800000000 removed from guards in functions
  pack/2 and unpack/2.

  There was one 0 too many on that conditions.

  Now the command_status is assumed to be always 0 on request PDUs.
- Function command_status/1 added.
- Small change in unpack_tlvs/2.  Now call unpack_tlvs/3 instead of looping
  back to unpack_tlvs/2 when discarding unsupported TLVs.
